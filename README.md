# control-structures-javascript

### IF, ELSE & ELSE IF conditional statements + Repitition or Looping control structures:

* As the project title suggests, this project involves working with JavaScript Control Structures.
* We'll dive into working with conditional statements & looping.
* This is one of my first projects working with JavaScript.

## Expected output:

* Page 1, code ouput:
<img src="/images/Capture.JPG" alt="code output in console">
<hr/>

* Page 2, code output:
<img src="/images/Capture2.JPG" alt="code output in console">

<b> Please note: </b>

* In order to run code in the console, it is important to install Node.js first.
* Run code or display variables in the console by typing 'node & [File Name]'.
* Example: 'node dataType.js'.
* Bare in mind that this needs to be typed within the command line interface/terminal.
