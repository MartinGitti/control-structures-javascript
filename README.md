# javascript-control-structures

As the project title suggests, this project involves working with JavaScript Control Structures.

## Expected output:

<img src="/images/Capture.JPG" alt="code output in console">
<img src="/images/Capture2.JPG" alt="code output in console">

## Please note:

* In order to run code in the console, it is important to install Node.js first.
* Run code or display variables in the console by typing 'node & [File Name]'.
* Example: 'node dataType.js'.
* Bare in mind that this needs to be typed within the command line interface/terminal.

Happy coding :sunglasses:
